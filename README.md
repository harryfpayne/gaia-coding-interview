Here's my solution to the coding exercise. Hope you like it!.
There's a few bits I'd probably tweak if I had more time, but we can talk about it tomorrow.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
